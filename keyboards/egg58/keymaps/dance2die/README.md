# egg58:dance2die

This is a custom keymap for @dance2die for egg58

ğŸ›ˆ**NOTE**: The document was created and tested on Windows 11 version 22621.1702


## How it was created

_Personal cheatsheat_

### Download source code

- Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dance2die/qmk_firmware_egg58
cd qmk_firmware_egg58
```

- Check out the egg58 branch

```bash
# This can take about a minute initially
git checkout egg58
```


### Configure environment defaults

- https://docs.qmk.fm/#/newbs_building_firmware?id=configure-your-build-environment-defaults-optional

```bash
alias q=qmk
alias c=clear
q config user.keyboard=egg58
q config user.keymap=dance2die
```

### Set up QMK

```bash
# this takes a few minutes
q setup
```

### Create a new keymap

- https://docs.qmk.fm/#/newbs_building_firmware?id=create-a-new-keymap
- This will use the profile in the previous step to create a keyboard for dance2die

```bash
q new-keymap
# To be explicit,
q new-keymap -kb egg58 -keymap dance2die
```

## Flashing the Egg58 firmware

- Open QMK MSYS
- Build the source (Do this once)

```bash
q compile
# wit explicit arguments
q compile -kb egg58 -km dance2die
```

The output will looks like below

```bash
[dance@LAPTOP-4L4BKQ0U qmk_firmware_egg58]$ q compile

At this point, the command will look for Egg58 in bootloader mode

### Bootloader mode

- You can turn on the bootloader mode by resetting the keyboard
  - Quickly touch "RESET" + "GRND" twice

The final output looks like this

```bash
